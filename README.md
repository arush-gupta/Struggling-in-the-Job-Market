# Struggling in the Job Market: The Over-Reliance on Robotic Competence

This article explores the growing shift from **human competence**â€”the ability to learn and grow within a roleâ€”to **robotic competence**, where employees are expected to be immediately productive from day one.

## Key Topics:
- How **corporate instability** is driving short-term hiring practices.
- The **declining value of degrees** and the mismatch between education and employment.
- The **paradox of competence**, where early specialization clashes with long-term adaptability.
- The **role of social media** in reshaping the hiring process into a rejection-first market.

With job security decreasing and hiring standards rising, companies now prioritize efficiency over stability, leaving workers to navigate an increasingly competitive and uncertain labor market.
